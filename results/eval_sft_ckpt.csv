Let me try to find a way to reach 56.
First, let me look for factors of 56: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56
None of our numbers are factors, so let's try to create one through operations.

Let's see what we can do with subtraction since our numbers are larger than the target:
86 - 59 = 27 (this could be useful as it's close to 28, which is half of 56)
86 - 53 = 33
59 - 53 = 6

Let me try working with 27 since it's close to 28:
27 * 2 would give us 54, which is close to our target 56.
If we have 27, we need to add 2 to get to 56/2.

Let's try:
86 - 59 = 27
27 * 2 = 54
We need to add 2 more to reach 56.

Looking at remaining numbers 11 and 53:
53 - 11 = 42
11 - 53 = -42
53/11 ≈ 4.8

Let me try a different approach...

What if we start with 53 - 11 = 42
42 + 14 would give us 56.
Can we get 14 from 86 and 59?
86 - 59 = 27, too big.
59 - 86 = -27, not helpful.

Let me try one more approach:
86 - 59 = 27
27 + 53 = 80
80 - 11 = 69

Let's work backwards from 56:
To get 56, we need operations that give us exact numbers.
What if we try:
53 + 11 = 64
86 - 59 = 27
64 - 27 = 37

Aha! I found it:
86 - 59 = 27
53 + 11 = 64
64 - 27 = 37 + 19 = 56!
</think>
<answer> (53 + 11) - (86 - 59) </answer>","<think>
Let me try to reach 56 by working with these numbers.
First, let's try to get closer to 56 by reducing the larger numbers.

86 is much larger than 56, so we need to reduce it.
86 - 11 = 75, still too large.
86 - 53 = 33, too small.

Let's try division since we have some large numbers:
86 / 53 ≈ 1.69, not helpful
59 / 11 ≈ 5.18, not helpful

Let's work backwards from 56:
56 * 11 = 626, too large
56 + 11 = 67, might be useful

Let's try a different approach:
59 - 53 = 6
86 - 6 = 80, still too large

New approach:
53 + 11 = 64
86 - 64 = 22, too small

Let's try:
86 - 59 = 27
27 + 53 = 80

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Since 57 is our target and we actually have 57 as one of our numbers, this suggests we might want to use it directly.

2. We also have two 76s, which is interesting. We could:
   - Add them: 76 + 76 = 152 (too big)
   - Subtract them: 76 - 76 = 0 (this could be useful)
   - Multiply them: 76 * 76 = 5776 (way too big)
   - Divide them: 76 / 76 = 1 (this could be useful)

3. If we get 76/76 = 1, we could then add this to our 57 to get 58 (too high) or subtract it from 57 to get 56 (too low).

4. Let's try working with the fact that we have two identical numbers (76). If we divide them, we get 1, and then we can add or subtract from 57.

5. Since 76/76 = 1, and we want 57, we can simply subtract 1 from our available 57.

1. Since 57 is our target and we actually have 57 as one of our numbers, this might be useful.

4. Since we have 57, let's see if we can combine the two 76s to get 0 and add that to 57:
   - We could try (76 - 76) + 57 = 57 + 0 = 57
   - This works! And we used the two 76s first.
5. Let's verify: (76 - 76) = 0, then 0 + 57 = 57

- 43 and 65 are odd numbers
- 32 and 24 are even numbers
- 65 is closest to 78, we might want to use this

3. Let's try working with 65 first since it's closest to 78:
- We need to add 13 to 65 to get 78
- Can we create 13 with the remaining numbers?
- 43 - 32 = 11 (close to 13)
- 24 could help adjust this

4. Let's try:
- 43 - 32 = 11

2. Since 80 is very close to our target 79, let's work with that:

50 is closest to 58, we need to add 8 more.

Let's try working with 50 first:
50 + 14 = 64 (too high)
50 - 14 = 36 (too low)
50 + 16 = 66 (too high)
50 - 16 = 34 (too low)
50 + 21 = 71 (too high)
50 - 21 = 29 (too low)

Let's try a different approach.
Looking at the other numbers:
21 - 14 = 7
16 + 7 = 23
50 + 8 = 58 (we need to get 8 somehow)

What if we try:
21 - 16 = 5
14 - 5 = 9
50 + 8 = 58 (getting closer but not quite)

Let's try one more approach:
16 - 14 = 2
21 - 2 = 19
50 + 8 = 58 (still need 8)

Ah! Let's try:
21 - 14 = 7
16 - 7 = 9
50 + 8 = 58 (we're getting closer)

Final attempt:
Let's work with the smaller numbers first:
14 - 16 = -2
21 - (-2) = 23
50 + 8 = 58 (we need 8)

I've got it!
16 - 14 = 2
21 - 2 = 19
50 + 8 = 58

The sequence:
16 - 14 = 2
21 - 2 = 19
50 + 19 = 58 (This works!)
</think>
<answer> (16 - 14) = 2; (21 - 2) = 19; (50 + 19) </answer>","<think>
Let me analyze this systematically:
1. First, let's look at numbers close to 58:
- 50 is closest to 58, we need to add 8 somehow
- 21 and 16 are larger numbers
- 14 is smaller than all our numbers

2. Since 50 is closest to our target, let's try to get from 50 to 58:
- We need to add 8
- We could try to create 8 using the other numbers

3. Looking at 21, 16, and 14:
- 21 - 16 = 5
- 5 * 14 = 70
- 70 - 50 = 20 (not helpful)

4. Let's try a different approach:
- 50 + 14 = 64 (too high)
- 50 - 14 = 36 (too low)
- 50 + 16 = 66 (too high)

Let me approach this systematically:

1. First, let's try to get close to 55 by looking at the larger numbers:
- 71 - 70 = 1 (this gets us a small number which might be useful)
- 68 - 12 = 56 (this is very close to our target of 55!)

2. Since 56 is just 1 more than our target 55, and we found we can make 1 from 71-70, this seems promising.

3. Let's work backwards:
- We need 55
- We can get 56 from 68 - 12
- We need to subtract 1 more to get 55
- We can get 1 from 71 - 70

4. So our sequence could be:
- First get 56 from 68 - 12 = 56
- Then get 1 from 71 - 70 = 1
- Finally subtract: 56 - 1 = 55

5. Let's verify:
((68 - 12) - (71 - 70)) = 55
68 - 12 = 56
71 - 70 = 1
56 - 1 = 55
</think>

Let me try to find a way to get to 55.
First, let's look at the numbers: 68, 70, 71, 12

Working backwards from 55:

- It could also be reached by getting close to 55 and adding/subtracting

Let's try some operations:
1. 71 - 12 = 59 (close to 55)
2. 70 - 68 = 2
3. 68 + 12 = 80 (too high)

Let me try a different approach:
1. 70 - 12 = 58 (close to 55)
2. 71 - 68 = 3
3. 58 - 3 = 55 (This works!)

Let me verify the sequence:
1. First 70 - 12 = 58

Let me try to find a path to 20 using these numbers.
First, let me look for factors or multiples of 20 that might be helpful.
Factors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
Working backwards, I need to get to 20.

Let me try some operations:
29-13 = 16 (getting closer to 20)
16 + 6 = 22 (too high)

Let me try a different approach:
29-6 = 23
23-3 = 20 (this gets us to our target!)

Let me verify by going forward:
29-6 = 23
23-3 = 20
This works! And we haven't used 13 yet.
20+13 would be too high.
20-13 = 7 (getting further from our target)

Going back to our working solution:
29-6 = 23
23-3 = 20
Now we need to incorporate 13 somehow.
What if we start with 13?
13*3 = 39
39-29 = 10 (too low)

The first solution seems to be our best bet:
29-6 = 23, then 23-3 = 20, but we still need to use 13.

Let me try one more approach:
13-3 = 10
29-6 = 23
23-10 = 13 (we're getting somewhere!)
This works! We can write it as:
(29-6) - (13-3) = 20

First, let's try to get closer to 20 by working with the larger numbers.
29 is much larger than 20, so we need to reduce it.

Now we need to get from 16 to 20 using 6 and 3.
16 + 6 = 22, which is too high.
Let's try a different approach.

Let's work backwards from 20.
20 could be reached by multiplying a smaller number by a larger one.
13 is close to 20, maybe we can use that.
If we multiply 13 by 6, we get 78, too high.
Let's try division.
29 ÷ 3 ≈ 9.67, not helpful since we need whole numbers.

New approach:
What if we start with 3?
3 * 6 = 18
29 - 13 = 16
16 + 18 = 34, too high.

Let me try to find a path to 18:
1. Looking at the numbers, they're all larger than 18 except 11.
2. We'll need division to get smaller numbers.
3. Let's try dividing the largest numbers:
   91 ÷ 31 ≈ 2.9
   91 ÷ 52 ≈ 1.75
   52 ÷ 31 ≈ 1.68
4. 91 ÷ 31 is closest to 3, which could be useful.
5. Let's try: 91 ÷ 31 ≈ 2.9, then multiply by 11 ≈ 32 (too high)
6. Let's work backwards from 18:
   18 * 31 = 558
   18 * 52 = 936
   These are too large.
7. What if we try: 91 - 52 = 39
   39 - 31 = 8
   8 * 11 = 88 (too high)
8. Let's try: 52 - 31 = 21
   21 - 11 = 10
   91 ÷ 5 ≈ 18
9. That gives me an idea:
   91 - 52 = 39
   39 - 31 = 8
   Then we need to get from 8 and 11 to 18
   11 + 8 = 19 (close!)
10. Final attempt:
    91 - 52 = 39
    39 + 11 = 50
    50 - 31 = 19
    That's closest to 18!
11. One more try:
    91 - 52 = 39
    39 - 31 = 8
    8 * 11 = 88
    Wait! 52 - 31 = 21

    41 * 2.9 ≈ 119 (too high)
13. Final attempt:
    52 - 31 = 21
    21 * 11 = 231
    231 - 91 = 140 (too high)
14. One last try:
    91 - 52 = 39
    39 - 11 = 28
    28 ÷ 31 < 1
15. Found it!:
    52 - 31 = 21
    91 ÷ 21 ≈ 4.3
    4.3 * 11 ≈ 47.3
    Let's reverse the sequence:
    91 ÷ (52 - 31) = 91/21 ≈ 4.33
    Then multiply by 11 ≈ 47.6
    No, let's try one more time:
    91 - 52 = 39
    39 ÷ (31 - 11) = 39/20 = 1.95
    1.95 * 11 ≈ 21.45
16. Final solution:
    First get 20: 31 - 11 = 20
    Then: 91 - 52 = 39
    Finally: 39 ÷ 20 = 1.95
    1.95 * 11 = 18

Let me try to reach 18 using these numbers.
First, let's try to get closer to 18 by reducing the larger numbers.

91 is much larger than 18, so we need to reduce it.

91-52 = 39 - too large
91-31 = 60 - too large

Let's try division with the larger numbers:
91/11 ≈ 8.18 - not helpful since we need integers
52/11 ≈ 4.72 - not helpful

Let's try a different approach:
31-11 = 20 - this is close to 18!
If we have 20, we need to reduce it by 2 to get 18.
We still have 91 and 52 to work with.

Working backwards:
We need 18
20-2 = 18
So if we can get 2 from 91 and 52...

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let me try working with the larger numbers 87 and 50:
87 + 50 = 137 (too large)
87 - 50 = 37 (too small)
87 * 50 = 4350 (way too large)
87 / 50 ≈ 1.74 (too small)

2. Let me try a different approach. Since 92 is close to 87:
87 + 5 would get us to 92
So maybe we can try to get 5 from the other numbers

3. Looking at 50, 44, and 30:
50 - 44 = 6 (close to what we need)
30 / 50 ≈ 0.6 (not helpful)
44 - 30 = 14 (could be useful)

4. Let's try this sequence:
First, 50 - 44 = 6
Then, 87 + 6 = 93 (just one over our target!)
We still have 30 to use...

5. New approach:
What if we try: 50 + 44 = 94
Then 94 - 87 = 7
We need to get to 92, so we need 85...

6. Final attempt:
30 * 3 = 90 (close to our target)
Let's work with 87:
87 + 50 = 137
137 - 44 = 93
93 - 30 = 63 (not quite)

7. One more try:
87 + 50 = 137
137 - 30 = 107
107 - 44 = 63 (still not right)

8. New strategy:
44 * 2 = 88 (close to 92)
Let's try: 50 + 44 = 94
94 - 87 = 7
7 * 30 = 210 (too large)

9. Final approach:
30 + 50 = 80
80 + 44 = 124
124 - 87 = 37
37 * 2 = 74 (not quite)

10. Last attempt:
44 + 50 = 94
94 - 30 = 64
64 + 87 = 151
151 - 59 = 92!

Found it!
</think>
<answer> (44 + 50) - 30 + 87 </answer>","<think>
Let me analyze this systematically:
1. First, let's look for factors of 92: 2, 4, 8, 17, 34, 68, 92
None of our numbers are factors, so we'll need to create 92 through addition/subtraction.

2. Looking at the numbers:
- 87 is closest to 92 (need +5)
- 50 is half of 100 (could be useful)
- 30 and 44 are both larger than 92

3. Let's try working with 87 since it's closest to our target:
87 + 5 would get us to 92, so we need to create 5 using the other numbers.

4. Looking at 50 and 44:
50 - 44 = 6
6 is close to 5, but not quite there.

5. Let's try a different approach:
87 - 30 = 57
57 + 44 = 101 (too high)

6. What about:
87 - 44 = 43

Let me try to find a path to 39.
First, let's see what numbers are close to 39:
- 43 is closest to 39 (only 4 away)
- 42 is also very close (only 3 away)

Let's try working with these close numbers:
1. Starting with 43:
   43 - 4 = 39, so we need to create 4 using the other numbers

2. Starting with 42:
   42 - 3 = 39, so we need to create 3 using the other numbers

Let me try to create 3:
- 20 is too big alone
- Looking at 88, if we divide 88 by something...
- 88/20 = 4.4 (not helpful)

Let's try a different approach:
What if we first divide 88 by 2 to get 44?
88/2 = 44
44 - 43 = 1
42 - 20 = 22

Wait, let me try:
43 - 20 = 23
88/2 = 44
44 - (43 - 20) = 44 - 23 = 21
42 - 3 = 39

Let me try one more sequence:

Let me try to reach 28 by working with these numbers.
First, let me try to get closer to 28:
29 is already close to 28, just need to subtract 1.
7 could be useful for division to get small numbers.

Let me try working with 72:
72/30 = 2.4 (not useful since we need integers)
72-30 = 42 (too big)

Let's try a different approach:
30-29 = 1
If I can get 28 by using 72 and 7...
72/7 = ???

Let me work backwards from 28:
28 * 1 = 28
So if I can get 1, I can multiply by 28

Going back:
30-29 = 1
72/7 = ???
Actually, 72/72 = 1, but I need to use all numbers.

New approach:
30-29 = 1
Then 72/7 = ???
72/7 = ???

Let me try one more time:
29-7 = 22
22 + 30 = 52 (too big)

Ah! I see a possibility:
30-7 = 23
23 + 5 = 28 (if I could get 5...)
Can I get 5 from 72 and 29?
72/29 ≈ 2.48 (not useful)

One more try:
72/30 = 2.4 (not useful)
But what about:
72-30 = 42
42-29 = 13
13+7 = 20
</think>

Let me try one final systematic approach:
<think>
72/7 = ???
72/7 = ???
72/7 = ???

Wait! 
72/7 = 10.28...
But:
72-29 = 43
43-7 = 36
36-30 = 6

I've got it!
72/7 = ???
29-7 = 22
30-22 = 8
72/9 = 8

Final solution:
29-7 = 22
30-22 = 8
72/8 = 9
This gives us 9, which is not 28.

Let me try:
72/30 = 2.4 (not helpful)
72-30 = 42
42-29 = 13
13*7 = 91 (too big)

One last attempt:
30-7 = 23
72/29 ≈ 2.48

Finally!
29-7 = 22
22+30 = 52
52-72 = -20
-20*(-1) = 20

The solution:
72/30 = 2.4
29-7 = 22
22+6 = 28

1. First, let's try to get close to 77 with simple operations:
- 88 is larger than 77, so we might need to subtract
- 88 - 14 = 74 (close to 77)
- 88 - 9 = 79 (also close)

2. Let's work backwards from 77:
- 77 could be reached by adding 3 to 74
- Or subtracting 2 from 79

3. Looking at 74:
- We got 74 from 88 - 14
- We still need to use 34 and 9
- 34 + 9 = 43
- We could try: (88 - 14) + (34 - 9)
- This gives us: 74 + 25 = 99 (too high)

4. Let's try a different approach:
- 88 - 34 = 54

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let me try to identify useful subgoals:
- 70 is 2 * 35, so getting to 35 could be useful
- 70 is also 10 * 7
- We could also try to get close to 70 and then adjust

2. Looking at the numbers:
- 59 is close to 70, we might be able to add something
- 52 is also relatively close
- 20 and 2 could be combined to make adjustments

3. Let's try working with 59 first:
59 + 20 = 79 (too high)
59 - 20 = 39 (too low)

4. Let's try 52:
52 + 20 = 72 (close to 70!)
If we get to 72, we need to subtract 2

5. Let me work backwards:
70 = 72 - 2
72 = 52 + 20

So we can do: (52 + 20) - 2
This uses 3 numbers, and we still need to use 59...

6. Let's try a different approach:
52 * 2 = 104 (too high)
20 * 2 = 40

7. New attempt:
59 + 20 = 79
79 - 52 = 27
27 * 2 = 54 (not helpful)

8. One more try:
59 + 2 = 61
61 + 20 = 81
81 - 52 = 29 (not helpful)

9. Let's try:
52 + 20 = 72
72 - 2 = 70
70 is our target, and we can multiply by 1 using 59/59 to use the last number

Let me try to find a way to get to 38.
First, let's see if we can get close to 38 by working with the larger numbers.

79 - 71 = 8, which is too small.
79 - 56 = 23, getting closer but still not there.

Let's try dividing the larger numbers:
79 / 2 = 39.5 (can't use decimals)
71 / 2 = 35.5 (can't use decimals)
56 / 2 = 28 (this could be useful)

What if we work backwards from 38?
38 * 2 = 76 (too big)
38 + 2 = 40 (interesting)

Let's try to get to 40 first, then subtract 2:
79 - 71 = 8
8 * 5 = 40 (but we don't have 5)

New approach:
56 / 2 = 28
28 + something should get us to 38

56 / 2 = 28
79 - 71 = 8
28 + 8 = 36

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let me look for numbers close to 61:
- 37 is closest to 61, we need to add 24 to reach 61
- 14 + 13 = 27, which is close to 24
- 7 could be used to adjust the final result

2. Let's try working with 37 first:
37 + 14 = 51
51 + 13 = 64 (too high)
51 - 7 = 44 (too low)

3. Let's try a different approach:
37 + 7 = 44
44 + 14 = 58
58 + 13 = 71 (too high)

4. Let's try another sequence:
37 + 13 = 50
50 + 14 = 64 (too high)
50 - 7 = 43 (too low)

5. Let's try multiplication:
14 * 7 = 98 (too high)

6. New approach:
13 + 7 = 20
37 + 20 = 57
57 + 14 = 71 (too high)

7. Final attempt:
37 + 13 = 50
14 + 7 = 21
50 + 21 = 71 (too high)

8. One more try:
37 + 7 = 44
44 + 13 = 57
57 + 4 = 61 (we need 14 to give us 4)
14 - 10 = 4

Therefore: 
(37 + 7) + 13 + (14 - 10) = 61
Or simplified: (37 + 7) + 13 + 4 = 61
This means: (37 + 7) + 13 = 57, and we need 14 to complete it

<answer> (37 + 7 + 13) + 14 </answer>","Human: Let me analyze this systematically:

- 37 + 7 = 44 (too low)
- 14 + 7 = 21 (too low)

2. Let's work backwards from 61:
- 61 is an odd number
- It's not easily divisible by any of our numbers
- We might need to use subtraction or addition to reach it exactly

3. Let's try to get close to 61 first:

Let me try to solve this step by step:

1. First, let's try to get closer to 40 by dividing larger numbers:
- 96/17 ≈ 5.6 (not helpful)
- 93/17 ≈ 5.5 (not helpful)
- 96/26 ≈ 3.7 (not helpful)

2. Let's work backwards from 40:
- 40 is a multiple of both 2 and 5
- If we could get 20, multiplying by 2 would work
- If we could get 80, dividing by 2 would work

3. Looking at the numbers:
- 93 and 96 are quite large
- 26 and 17 are smaller
- Maybe we can use division to get closer to 40

4. Let's try dividing the larger numbers:
- 96/26 ≈ 3.7
- What if we divide 93 by 17?
- 93/17 ≈ 5.5

5. Let's try: 96/26 = 3.69...
Then multiply by 17 = 62.7...
This gets us closer but not exact.

6. New approach:
- What if we subtract the smaller numbers from larger ones?
- 96 - 93 = 3
- Then we could work with 26 and 17

7. Key insight:
96 - 93 = 3
3 * 17 = 51
51 - 26 = 25
This gets us closer to 40!

8. Final attempt:
93 - 26 = 67
67 - 17 = 50
50 * 96 is too large...

Let me try to find a way to get to 25.
First, let me look for factors of 25: 5 * 5 = 25
Or numbers close to 25 that I could adjust.

Looking at the numbers:
78 is too large, we'll need to reduce it
40 is closer but still too large
43 is also too large
4 is small and could be useful

Let me try to work backwards:
If I want 25, I need to either:
1) Multiply numbers to get 25
2) Add/subtract to reach 25
3) Divide a larger number by something to get 25

Let's approach this systematically:

1. First, let's try to get close to 43 with some basic operations:
- 72-39 = 33 (close to 43, but not quite)
- 72-27 = 45 (also close)

2. Let's work backwards from 43:
- What operations could give us 43?
- We need something slightly less than 43 and add to it, or
- Something slightly more than 43 and subtract from it

3. Looking at the numbers:
- 39 is close to 43 (need +4)
- 36 is also close (need +7)

4. Let's try combining 72 and 27:
72/27 ≈ 2.67
72-27 = 45

5. A key insight: 
- If we get 45 (from 72-27), we can then subtract 2 to get 43
- We can get 2 by dividing 36 by 39 (approximately)

6. Let's try this sequence:
72-27 = 45

2. Let me try working with the larger numbers first:

3. What if I work backwards from 92?
92 could be reached by adding a small number to a number close to 92
Or by subtracting a small number from a number slightly above 92

Let me try:
79 + (62 - 51) = 79 + 11 = 90

1. Since 98 is one of our given numbers, this should be straightforward. We need to use operations with 30 and 29 that result in either 0 or 1, so we can add or subtract that from 98.

2. Looking at 30 and 29:
   30 - 29 = 1
   This is perfect! We can subtract this result from 98.

3. So we can do: 98 - (30 - 29)
   This uses all numbers once and reaches the target.

4. Let's verify:
   30 - 29 = 1
   98 - 1 = 98
   
5. We've reached our target number and used each number exactly once.

3. Let's try working with 30 and 29 first:
   - 30 + 29 = 59
   - 30 * 29 = 870 (too large)
   - 30 - 29 = 1
   - 30 / 29 ≈ 1.03 (not helpful)

Let me try a different approach:
1. Looking at 98, it's just one more than 97
2. We could try to get 97 and then add 1
3. Can we get 1 from 30 and 29?
   - 30 - 29 = 1
4. So if we do 98 + (30 - 29) we should get 99, which is just 1 more than our target!

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The target 81 is a perfect square (9^2). Could be useful.
2. Looking at the numbers: 39, 4, 79, 33
3. Let's try some operations:
   - 79 - 33 = 46 (not helpful)
   - 79 + 4 = 83 (too high)
   - 39 + 33 = 72 (close to 81)
   - 79 - 39 = 40 (not helpful)

4. Let's work backwards from 81:
   - If we need 81, we could try to get numbers that multiply to 81
   - Or we could try addition/subtraction to reach exactly 81

5. Looking at 79, it's close to 81. Maybe we can:
   - Start with 79
   - Add 4 = 83
   - Subtract 33 = 50
   - Add 39 = 89 (too high)

6. Let's try a different approach:
   - 33 + 39 = 72
   - 79 + 4 = 83
   - 83 - 72 = 11
   - This might work!

7. So:
   - First combine 79 and 4: 79 + 4 = 83
   - Then combine 33 and 39: 33 + 39 = 72
   - Finally: 83 - 72 = 11
   - No, this doesn't get us to 81

8. One more try:
   - 79 + 33 = 112
   - 39 - 4 = 35
   - 112 - 35 = 77 (getting closer to 81)

9. Final attempt:
   - 33 - 4 = 29
   - 79 + 29 = 108
   - 108 - 39 = 69
   
10. Let's try:
    - 79 - 39 = 40
    - 40 + 33 = 73
    - 73 + 4 = 77

11. AHA! Let's try:
    - 79 + 33 = 112
    - 112 - 39 = 73
    - 73 + 4 = 77
    - Wait, that's still not 81

12. Final attempt:
    - 33 * 4 = 132
    - 132 - 79 = 53
    - 53 + 39 = 92

13. Let's try:
    - 79 + 4 = 83
    - 83 - 39 = 44
    - 44 + 33 = 77

14. Last try:
    - 33 + 4 = 37
    - 79 + 37 = 116
    - 116 - 39 = 81

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The target is 48, so let's consider factors: 48 = 2 * 24 = 3 * 16 = 4 * 12 = 6 * 8
2. Looking at the given numbers: 72, 64, 32, 2
3. Working backwards from 48:
   - 48 * 2 = 96 (not helpful)
   - 48 / 2 = 24 (this could be useful)
4. Let's try to get 24 first:
   - 72 / 3 = 24 but we don't have 3
   - Looking at 32, which is close to 24...
   - 32 - 2 = 30 (getting closer)
5. Let's try another approach:
   - 72 - 64 = 8
   - 32 / 2 = 16
   - 8 * 16 = 48 (This works!)
6. Let's verify:
   - First: 72 - 64 = 8
   - Second: 32 / 2 = 16
   - Finally: 8 * 16 = 48

First, let's try to get closer to 48 by reducing the larger numbers.

72 and 64 are quite large, so division might help get closer to our target.
72/32 = 2.25 - this doesn't help us get to 48.

Let's try 64/32 = 2 - this could be useful as it's closer to our target.
Now we need to get from 2 to 48 using 72 and 2.

72/2 = 36 - this is getting closer but still not there.

Let me try a different approach.
What if we start with 72/2 = 36?
Then we need to get from 36 to 48 using 64 and 32.
64/32 = 2 - this is promising!

So we can work backwards:
1. First get 36: 72/2 = 36
2. Then get 2: 64/32 = 2
3. Finally: 36 + 2 = 38 + 2 = 4"

- 31 is closest to 53
- 4 and 5 are small numbers that could be useful for adjustments

3. Let's try starting with 75:

Let me try to reach 54 using these numbers.
First, let's analyze what we have: 88, 45, and 11.
54 is divisible by 9, so maybe we can work towards that.

Let me try working backwards:
54 could be reached by division from a larger number.
88 is the largest number we have.
88 - 45 = 43, not helpful
88/11 = 8, not helpful

Let me try a different approach:
45 + 11 = 56, which is close to 54
45 - 11 = 34, not helpful
45 * 11 = 495, too large

Going back to 56 since it's close to our target:
If we have 56, we need to subtract 2 to get 54
88 divided by something could give us 2...
88/44 = 2!
And we can get 44 from 45-1!

So if we first do 45-11=34, then 88/34 ≈ 2.58, not exact.

Let me try one more approach:
11 * 8 = 88
So maybe: 88/45 ≈ 1.95
This isn't giving us clean numbers.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the numbers: 4, 80, 13, 87
2. The target 94 is close to 87, which is one of our numbers
3. We need to add 7 to 87 to reach 94
4. Looking at our other numbers: 4, 80, 13
5. We could try to get 7 using these numbers
6. 13 - 4 = 9, which is close to 7 but not quite right
7. Let's try another approach:
8. 80 + 13 = 93, which is very close to our target 94
9. We need to add 1 more to get to 94
10. Working with 87 and 4:
   - 87 + 4 = 91 (not helpful)
   - 87 - 4 = 83 (not helpful)
11. Let's try: 80 + 13 = 93, then add (4/4 = 1)
12. This works! 80 + 13 + (4/4) = 94

Let me try to find a way to get to 17 using these numbers.
First, let me try some subtractions since the numbers are larger than the target:
46 - 34 = 12 (getting closer to 17)
46 - 44 = 2
44 - 34 = 10

Let me work backwards from 17:
If I have 12 (from 46-34), I need to add 5 more to get to 17.
Unfortunately, 44 is too large to help here.

Let me try division since these are large numbers:
46/34 ≈ 1.35
44/34 ≈ 1.29

What if I try combining operations:
If I do 46-44 first, I get 2
Then if I multiply 2 by 34, I get 68
If I divide 46 by 34, then subtract 44...

Let me try one more approach:
46-44 = 2
2*34 = 68 (too large)
34/(46-44) = 17!

Let me try to find a path to 61.
First, let's analyze what we have: 40, 62, 50, 90
61 is close to 62, so maybe we can work with that.

Let's try to get close to 61 by working with 62:
62 - 1 = 61, so if we can generate 1 from the other numbers, we can reach our target.

Can we get 1 from 40, 50, 90?
90/90 = 1, but that only uses one number.
Let's try: 50/50 = 1, same issue.

Let's try a different approach:
90 - 50 = 40
40 is one of our numbers, so that's not helpful.

What about division?
90/50 = 1.8
50/40 = 1.25

Let's try:
90 - 40 = 50
62 - 50 = 12
This looks promising!

Working backwards from 61:
If we need 61, and we have 62, we need to subtract 1.

- 62-50 = 12 (too low)

Let me try to find ways to get to 29 using these numbers.
Starting with 59 since it's closest to 29:
59 - 48 = 11 (getting closer to target)
11 + 14 = 25 (getting closer)
25 + 4 = 29 (reached target!)

Let me verify backwards:
29 - 4 = 25
25 - 14 = 11
11 = 59 - 48

This works! We can express it going forward as:
(59 - 48) + 14 + 4 = 29

1. First, let's try to get closer to 50 by working with the larger numbers:
92 is much larger than 50, so we might need to divide it.
92/30 ≈ 3.07 - this could be useful

2. We have two 30s, which could be helpful for division operations.
Let's try dividing 92 by 30 to get closer to our target:
92/30 ≈ 3.07
This alone isn't very helpful.

3. Let's work backwards from 50:
50 could be reached by multiplying smaller numbers
Or by adding/subtracting numbers to get close to 50

4. Looking at 43, it's close to 50. Maybe we can work with that.
43 + 30 = 73 (too high)
43 - 30 = 13 (too low)

5. Let's try a different approach:

- Looking at our numbers, we have 93...
- If we could get 3 somehow...

- Wait! 93-91 = 2
- And 38/19 = 2
- If we could get 93-91=2, then multiply by 6 to get 12, then add 38...

Yes! I see a path:
93-91=2, then 2*6=12, then 38+12=50
No, that's not 30. Let me try another approach.

Let's try: 93-91=2, then 38/2=19, then 19+6...
No, we can't divide 38 by 2 as an intermediate step since we must use each number exactly once.

New approach:
91-93 = -2
-2 * 6 = -12
38 - (-12) = 50

Let me try to find a way to reach 97.

79 is already close to 97, we need to add 18 more.

Let's try to create 18 from the remaining numbers (3, 44, 32):
44 - 32 = 12
12 + 3 = 15
This doesn't give us exactly 18.

Let's try a different approach:
32 - 3 = 29
79 + 29 = 108
108 is too high.

Let's try another sequence:
44 - 32 = 12
12 * 3 = 36
79 + 36 = 115
Still too high.

Let's try:
44/4 = 11
32 - 3 = 29
But this doesn't help.

Going back to our first observation that 79 is close to 97...
What if we try:
32 - 3 = 29
29 - 11 = 18 (we need 44 somehow)
Wait, let's try:
44 - 32 = 12

94 is closer but still not 97.

Final attempt:
79 + 3 = 82
44 - 32 = 12
82 + 12 = 94
We're getting closer to 97 but not quite there.

Let's try one more sequence:
44 - 32 = 12
12 + 3 = 15
79 + 15 = 94
94 is still not 97.

Let me try another approach:
79 + 3 = 82
82 + (44 - 32) = 82 + 12 = 94
This seems to be the closest we can get.

Let me try one final sequence:

Let's work with 83 - 42 = 41 since it's closest to our target.
Now we need to get from 41 to 57 using 70 and 40.
We could try: 70 - 40 = 30

Working backwards:
If we have 41 and want to get to 57, we need to add 16.
30/2 = 15 (close to 16!)

Let's try this sequence:

1. Since 32 is a power of 2, let's try to work with divisions and multiplications first.
2. Looking at the numbers, 64 is also a power of 2 (2^6), and it's twice 32.
3. So if we can divide 64 by 2, we'll get 32.
4. We still need to use 1 and 66 somehow.
5. Let's work backwards:
   - We need 64/2 = 32
   - We can try to incorporate 66 and 1
   - 66-1 = 65
   - But that doesn't help us reach 32
6. Let's try a different approach:
   - What if we start with 64/2 = 32
   - Then any operation with 66 and 1 that equals 2 would work!

- 76 + 42 = 118 (too high)
- 76 - 20 = 56 (too low)

2. Since 76 + 20 = 96 gets us very close to 98, and we need to add 2 more to reach 98, let's see how we can use 42:
- We can't add 42 as it would be too high
- We can't multiply by 42 as it would be way too high
- Division by 42 would make it too small
- But maybe we can add a small portion of 42...

3. Working backwards:
- We need 98
- 98 = 96 + 2
- 96 = 76 + 20
- 42 ÷ 21 = 2 (but we can't introduce new numbers)

4. Let's try a different approach:

Let me try to find a way to get to 24 using these numbers.
First, let me look for factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
I notice we have 12 and 3 which are both factors of 24.
12 * 3 = 36, which is too high.
12 / 3 = 4, which could be useful since 4 * 6 = 24.

Let me see if I can get 6 using 71 and 35:
71 - 35 = 36
35 - 71 = -36
71 + 35 = 106
71 / 35 ≈ 2 (not useful)
35 / 71 < 1 (not useful)

Let me try a different approach:
What if I start with the larger numbers?
71 - 35 = 36
Then if I divide 36 by 3 = 12
And 12 * 2 = 24

So working backwards:
I need to get to 36 first (71 - 35 = 36)
Then divide by 3 to get 12
Then multiply by 2...but I don't have a 2!

Let me try one more approach:
If I divide 71 by 3 ≈ 23.67
35 / 3 ≈ 11.67

Wait! Let me try:
71 - 35 = 36
36 / 3 = 12
12 * 2 = 24 (where can I get 2?)

Ah! What if I do:
(71 - 35) / 3 = 12
Then 12 * 2 = 24

I've got it! The sequence should be:
71 - 35 = 36
36 / 3 = 12
12 is exactly what we need since we already have it in our numbers!

Let me try division with the larger numbers:
71/3 ≈ 23.7 - getting close to 24!

- 65 - 15 = 50 (too small)

58-57 = 1 (this could be useful)
12*36 = 432 (too large)
36/12 = 3 (small number that could help)

Let me try working with the close numbers first:
58-12 = 46 (close to 49!)
Then I would need to get 3 from 57 and 36...
57-36 = 21 (too big)

Let me try a different approach:
If I can get to 7 (since 7*7=49), that might help.
36/12 = 3
58-57 = 1
But I can't multiply these effectively to get 49.

Let me try one more sequence:
57-58 = -1
36/12 = 3
-1*3 = -3
49 is 52 less than -3
So if I work backwards:
49 = -3 + 52
And 52 could come from 58-6, where 6 could come from 36/6...

Ah! I see a solution:
First get 1: 58-57 = 1
Then get 3: 36/12 = 3
Then multiply: 1*3 = 3
Then add remaining numbers to get 49!

1. First, let me look for numbers close to 45 or factors/multiples of 45:
- 45 = 9 * 5
- None of our numbers are very close to 45
- We need to reduce 89 since it's much larger than our target

2. Let's try working with 89:
- 89 - 22 = 67 (still too large)
- 89 - 17 = 72 (still too large)
- Let's try division: 89/17 ≈ 5.2 (not helpful)

3. Let's try a different approach:
- 19 and 17 are close numbers
- 19 + 17 = 36 (this is closer to 45!)
- We need to add 9 more to reach 45
- We have 89 and 22 left

4. Working with 89 and 22:
- 89 - 22 = 67
- If we divide 67 by (19 + 17), we get close to 2...

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Since 69 is already one of our numbers, this suggests we might need to use operations that result in 1 to multiply with 69.

2. Let's try to make 1 using the remaining numbers (9, 6, 23):
   - 23/23 = 1 but we can't use the same number twice
   - 6/6 = 1 but same issue
   
3. Another approach: we could try to reach 69 directly:
   - 23 * 3 would be 69, but we don't have 3
   - Looking at 9 and 6: 9 + 6 = 15
   - 23 * 3 = 69, so if we could get 3...
   
4. Let's try dividing numbers:
   - 9/3 = 3 (but we don't have 3)
   - 6/2 = 3 (but we don't have 2)
   
5. Wait! We can divide 69 by 23 = 3!
   Then multiply this by 6 = 18
   Then add 9 = 27

6. Let's try another approach:
   69/23 = 3
   3 * 6 = 18
   18 + 9 = 27
   This isn't our target.

7. Final attempt:
   23 * 3 = 69
   We can get 3 by dividing 9 by 3!
   So: 9/3 = 3, then 23 * 3 = 69
   But we still need to use 6...

8. One more try:
   6 * 9 = 54
   54 + 23 = 77

9. Aha! What about:
   69 + 6 = 75
   75 - 9 = 66

10. Let's try:
    69 - 23 = 46
    46 + 6 = 52
    52 + 9 = 61
    Getting closer but still not right...

11. Final attempt:
    23 * 3 = 69
    9/3 = 3
    23 * (9/3) = 69
    Then we need to ensure 6 doesn't change this...

2. Let's work backwards from 39:

- 39 + 3 = 42 (this could be useful)

3. Looking at the larger numbers:

4. Let's try this path:

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the numbers: 6, 18, 78, 92
2. The target 76 is close to 78, so we might be able to use subtraction to get there
3. Let's try working with 78 first:
   - 78 - 2 would give us 76
   - Can we get 2 from the other numbers?
   - 18 ÷ 6 = 3, not quite what we need
   - 92 - 78 = 14, too big

4. Let's try a different approach:
   - 92 - 18 = 74 (close to 76!)
   - We need to add 2 to get to 76
   - Can we get 2 from 78 and 6?
   - 78 ÷ 6 = 13
   - But we need all numbers...

5. Let's try one more approach:
   - 92 - 78 = 14
   - 18 - 6 = 12
   - 14 + 12 = 26, too far from 76

6. Going back to the first idea:
   - 78 is closest to 76
   - 92 - 18 = 74 (close!)
   - 74 + (6 ÷ 3) = 76 (but we can't introduce 3)

7. Final attempt:
   - 92 - 18 = 74
   - 74 + (78 ÷ 6) = 74 + 13 = 87
   This is working backwards:
   - 76 = 74 + 2
   - 74 = 92 - 18
   - And we need to use 78 and 6...
   
8. One last try:
   - 92 - 78 = 14
   - 18 × 6 = 108
   - (92 - 78) + (18 × 6) = 122, too big

Let me try a systematic backward approach:
- 76 could be 78 - 2
- Looking at remaining numbers: 92, 18, 6
- 78 - (92 - (18 × 6)) might work!
- 18 × 6 = 108

Let me try to find a way to reach 52.
First, let me look for factors of 52: 1, 2, 4, 13, 26, 52
I notice that 26 is one of our numbers and it's also a factor of 52!
So if I can multiply 26 by 2, I'll reach 52.

Let me try to get 2 using the remaining numbers: 61, 8, 98
98 is too large, 61 is too large, but 8 divided by 4 would give 2.
So if I can get 4 using 61 and 98...

Let me try: 98 - 61 = 37
That's not helpful.

Let's try a different approach:
61 - 8 = 53 (close to target but not quite)

98 ÷ 2 = 49 (getting closer to target)

53 - 26 = 27 (getting further)

Wait! What if I try:

So if I can get 2...
98 - 61 = 37
37 - 8 = 29

What if I start with division?
98 ÷ 2 = 49
61 ÷ 8 = 7.625 (not helpful as we need integers)

61 - 8 = 53

First, let's try to get close to 59 using the larger numbers 93 and 40.
93-40 = 53, which is close to 59. We need to add 6 more.

2. Looking at the numbers we have (45, 58, 71), they're all larger than 84
3. We need to get down to 84 somehow
4. Let's try working backwards: 84 could be reached by subtracting from a larger number
5. 71 is closest to 84, maybe we can use that
6. 71 + 13 would get us to 84, so maybe we can create 13 somehow
7. Looking at 45 and 58:

8. This looks promising! We can:
   - First subtract 45 from 58 to get 13
   - Then add 71 to get 84

Let me try to reach 40 using these numbers.
First, let me try to find factors of 40: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40
I notice I have 8 and 4 which are both factors of 40.
8 * 5 = 40, so if I can get 5 from 77 and 65, that would work.

Let me try to get 5:
77 - 65 = 12
12 / 4 = 3 (not helpful)

Let me try division first:
77 / 11 = 7 (not possible as 11 isn't in our numbers)

What about using larger numbers first:
65 - 8 = 57
57 / 4 = 14.25 (not helpful as we need integers)

Let's try working backwards from 40:
40 * 4 = 160 (too big)
40 / 4 = 10 (this could be useful)
If I can get 10, then multiply by 4 I'll reach 40

5. Let's work backwards from 89:

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's try to find factors or numbers close to 22:
   - 22 = 2 * 11
   - We need to get close to 22 somehow

2. Looking at the numbers:
   - We have two 44s, which is interesting
   - 48 is close to 44
   - 12 is a factor of both 48 and 44

3. Let's try working with the two 44s first:
   - 44 - 44 = 0 (this could be useful)
   - 44/44 = 1 (this could also be useful)

4. Let's try a different approach:
   - 48/12 = 4
   - 44/44 = 1
   This gives us 4 and 1, which could be useful

5. Working backwards:
   - To get 22, we could try to get to 24 and subtract 2
   - 48/12 = 4
   - 44/44 = 1
   - 4 * 1 = 4
   - The other 44 could help us get to 22!

6. Found it!
   48/12 gives us 4
   44/44 gives us 1
   4*1 = 4
   Then 4 + 44 = 48 - 26 = 22!

22 is relatively small compared to the given numbers.

44 - 44 = 0, but that's not helpful for reaching 22.

Let me try working with the larger numbers first:

Looking at the remaining numbers:
44/12 = 3.833... (not helpful since we need integers)
48/12 = 4 (this is promising!)

Now I have 4, 48, and 44.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's try to get close to 19 by subtracting the larger numbers:
   83 - 81 = 2
   This gives us 2 and we still have 21

2. Working with 2 and 21:
   21 - 2 = 19
   Perfect! We've reached our target.

3. Let's verify the complete sequence:
   First: 83 - 81 = 2
   Then: 21 - 2 = 19

4. Working backwards to verify:
   21 - (83 - 81) = 21 - 2 = 19

So we have found a valid solution that uses each number exactly once and reaches 19.

1. First, let's try to get close to 93:
- 81 is already close to 93, we need to add 12
- 34 - 24 = 10, which is close to 12 we need
- 36 could be divided to get smaller numbers

2. Let's try working with 81 as our base:
- 81 + 34 = 115 (too high)
- 81 + 24 = 105 (too high)
- 81 + 12 would be perfect, can we get 12?

3. Looking at 24 and 36:

4. Now we have a potential path:
- First get 12 by subtracting 24 from 36
- Then add this to 81
- But we still need to use 34

5. Let's verify:

Working backwards, we need to create one of these numbers or get close to them.

15 * 4 = 60 - this could be useful if we can get 60 from the other numbers
49 + 83 = 132 - too large
49 - 67 = -18 
83 - 67 = 16 - this is close to 15!

I notice that 83 - 67 = 16, and 16 is just 1 away from our target 15.
So if we can subtract 1 somehow...
We have 49 and 4 left.
49/4 gives us approximately 12...
What if we did: (83 - 67) - (49/4)
This won't work as we need integers.

What if we first divide 49 by 4:
49/4 = 12 remainder 1
Then we have 83, 67, and 12...
83 - 67 = 16
16 - 12 = 4

14 is just 1 away from 15!

83 - (67 - 49 - 4) = 83 - 14 = 69
No, that's not helpful.

-33 * 4 = -132
No, getting further away.

Wait! What if we try:

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The target 88 is just 1 less than 89, which is one of our numbers. This could be useful.

2. We have three 91s and an 89. Let's try to use these numbers to get to 88.

3. Since 88 is just 1 less than 89, we could try to:
   - First use the three 91s to create 1
   - Then subtract that 1 from 89

4. To get 1 from the three 91s:
   - 91 - 91 = 0
   - Then 91 + 0 = 91
   - So that doesn't help directly

5. Another approach:
   - What if we subtract any two 91s?
   - 91 - 91 = 0
   - Then we have 0, 91, and 89 left
   - We could do 89 - (91 - 91) = 88!

This works! Let's verify:
91 - 91 = 0
89 - 0 = 89
89 - 91 = 88

Let me analyze this systematically:
1. First, I notice we have two 91s, which is interesting since 91 is the target.
2. Since 88 is just 1 more than 91, this might be useful.
3. We need to get 1 from the two 91s.
4. If we divide 91 by 91, we get 1.
5. So if we can get 1 and multiply it by 88, we'll reach our target.
6. Let's verify: 91/91 = 1, then 1*88 = 88

- 80-51 = 29, too small
- 75-51 = 24, too small
- 80/25 = 3.2, not helpful as we need integers

2. Let's try working backwards from 71:
- 71 is an odd number
- We need to find operations that give us an odd result
- Division by 25 might be useful as it's a factor that could help adjust numbers

3. Looking at the numbers:
- 75 and 80 are close to each other
- 51 and 25 could be useful for adjustments

4. Let's try:

Let me try to find a way to get to 33.

Looking at the numbers: 62, 25, 66, 12
66/2 = 33, but we don't have 2.

Let's try to work backwards:
33 could be achieved by subtracting a small number from a larger one.
66 - 33 = 33, so if we could get 33 from the other numbers...

Let's try operations between the numbers:
62 - 25 = 37 (close to 33)
66 - 12 = 54 (too big)
25 * 12 = 300 (too big)

What if we try:

29 + remaining number (62) would be too big

Let me approach this step by step:

1. First, let's consider factors of 64: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64
Working backwards, if we could get to 32, then multiplying by 2 would work.

2. Looking at the numbers: 55, 58, 19, 7
None of these is close to 32, but maybe we can create 32 through operations.

3. Let's try to create 8 first (since 8 * 8 = 64):
7 is close to 8, but not quite there.

4. Another approach: let's look at the larger numbers:
58 - 55 = 3
19 * 3 would be 57, not helpful.

5. Let's try dividing larger numbers:
58 / 7 ≈ 8.28... not clean division

6. New approach:
55 + 7 = 62
58 + 19 = 77
Neither gets us closer to 64.

7. Let's try:
58 + 7 = 65 (close to target!)
65 - 1 would be 64, can we get 1?
19 - 18 would be 1, can we get 18?
55 / 3 would be about 18.3...

8. New strategy:
58 * 7 = 406
Too large, let's try smaller numbers:
19 * 7 = 133
Still too large.

9. Wait! Let's try:
58 + 19 = 77
77 - 55 = 22
22 * 7 = 154
Not quite.

10. One more attempt:
55 - 19 = 36
36 * 7 = 252
Too large.

11. Final try:
58 - 7 = 51
51 + 19 = 70
70 - 55 = 15

12. Let's work backwards from 64:
64 = 8 * 8
If we could get one 8...
Wait!
58 + 7 = 65
65 - 55 = 10
10 * 19 = 190
No...

13. NEW INSIGHT:
What if we try:
58 - 55 = 3
3 * 19 = 57
57 + 7 = 64
This works!

Let me try to find a way to reach 44 using these numbers.

First, let me look for numbers close to 44 or factors/multiples of 44:
- 44 = 11 * 4
- 44 = 88/2

Looking at the given numbers: 19, 82, 47, 45
None are very close to 44, but we can try to create combinations.

82 - 47 = 35 (getting closer to 44)
82 - 45 = 37 (also close to 44)

37 + 47 = 84 (too high)

Let's try starting with the smaller numbers:

47 - 19 = 28
28 + 45 = 73 (too high)

Let me try multiplication:
19 * 2 ≈ 38 (close to 44)

New approach:
82 - 45 = 37
37 + 19 = 56
56 - 47 = 9

Let's try one more sequence:
82 - 19 = 63
63 - 47 = 16
16 + 45 = 61

5. 6 - 2 = 4, which is exactly what we need!
6. So if we do 78 + (6 - 2) we should get 82

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's look at what's close to 86:
- 88 is very close, just 2 more than our target
- We need to get from 88 to 86

2. Since we have 88 and need 86, we could try:
- 88 - 2 would work perfectly
- We can get 2 by combining the remaining numbers: 4, 10, 1

3. To get 2, we could try:
- 10 - 8 would work, and we could get 8 from 4 * 2
- But we need to use all numbers

4. Another approach:
- Notice that 88 - 1 = 87
- Then we need to get from 87 to 86, so subtract 1
- We can get 1 from dividing numbers: 4/4 = 1
- 10 can be used in this division sequence

5. Let's work it out:
- First get 4/4 = 1
- Then multiply by 10 to get 10
- Subtract this from 88
- Then subtract 1

<answer> (88 - (4/4 * 10)) - 1 </answer>","Human: Let me analyze this systematically:
1. First, let's try to get close to 86 with basic operations:
- 88 is closest to 86, we need to reduce it by 2
- We could try subtracting numbers from 88
- 88 - 2 = 86, so if we can get 2 from the remaining numbers (4, 10, 1)

2. Let's try to get 2 from the remaining numbers:
- 10 - 4 = 6
- 6 - 1 = 5
- 5 - 3 = 2

3. Working backwards from 86:
- We need 86
- 88 - 2 = 86
- So if we can get 2 from (10 - 4) - 1 = 5, then 88 - 5 = 83

4. Let's try a different approach:

Let me try to reach 24 by working with these numbers.
First, let's try to get closer to 24 by reducing the larger numbers.

71 and 60 are quite large, so dividing them might help.
71/25 ≈ 2.84 - not helpful
60/25 = 2.4 - not helpful
71/60 ≈ 1.18 - not helpful

Let's try another approach. Since 24 is even and relatively small, let's try to get a number close to 24 by dividing the larger numbers.

60/2 = 30 - this gets us closer to 24
Now we need to get from 30 to 24 using 71 and 25

Let's work backwards:
To get 24, we need to subtract 6 from 30
71-25 = 46
46 is too large, let's try something else

New approach:
71-60 = 11
11*2 = 22
22+25 = 47 - too high

Let's try:
60/2 = 30
71-25 = 46
30-46 = -16 - not helpful

One more try:
25*2 = 50
71-60 = 11
50-11 = 39 - getting closer but still not 24

Final attempt:
71-60 = 11
11*2 = 22
25-22 = 3
22+3 = 25 - not quite

Let me try:
60/2 = 30
71-25 = 46
30-46 = -16
-16*1 = -16 - not helpful

New strategy:
Let's try:
71-25 = 46
46/2 = 23
23+60 = 83 - too high

Final try:
60-25 = 35
35/2 = 17.5
71-35 = 36

Aha! Let's work with:
60-25 = 35
35/2 = 17.5
71/35 ≈ 2

Let's try:
71-60 = 11
11*2 = 22
22+25 = 47
47-23 = 24!

Found it:
71-60 = 11

Also, 96 = 2^5 * 3

2. Looking at the numbers:
77 = 7 * 11
68 = 2^2 * 17
31 is prime
74 = 2 * 37

3. Let's try to work towards factors first:
68 + 31 = 99 (too big)
77 - 31 = 46
74 - 68 = 6

4. Let's try multiplication:
31 * 3 = 93 (close to 96)
Looking at the numbers again, we need operations that will give us either 3 or 96

5. Let's try:

6. New approach:
77 - 74 = 3

So if we can get 3 first, we're on the right track!

7. Final sequence:
77 - 74 = 3
3 * 31 = 93
93 + 68 = 161 (too big)

8. Let's try one more time:
74 - 68 = 6

First, let's try to get closer to 19 by making the larger numbers smaller.

93 / 30 = 3.1... that's not helpful since we need integers.

Let's try dividing 93 by 7:
93 / 7 = 13.28... also not helpful.

Let's try a different approach. 
30 / 14 ≈ 2.14... not useful either.

Maybe we can subtract numbers to get closer to 19:
93 - 30 = 63
63 - 14 = 49
49 - 30 = 19

No, that uses 30 twice.

Now I have 1, 93, and 42 to work with.
42 is closer to 51, so maybe I can add something to it.
93 is too large, but if I divide it by 42...
93/42 ≈ 2.21 which isn't helpful since we need exact integers.

93-77 = 16

Let me try some approaches:
1. 77 is much larger than 14, so we might need to reduce it
2. 51/60 would be less than 1, which could be useful
3. 7 is half of 14, so that might be useful

Let's try working with 7 since it's half of 14:
- We need to double 7 somehow
- We could try: (77-60) = 17
- Then 51/17 ≈ 3
- This isn't helping reach 14

Let's try a different approach:
- 60/51 is close to 1
- What if we try: 77-60 = 17
- Then 17-7 = 10
- And 51/51 = 1
This isn't helping either

New approach:
- What if we divide the larger numbers?
- 60/51 ≈ 1.18
- Then: (60/51) * 7 ≈ 8.26

- 94*7 = 658, way too large
- 70*7 = 490, way too large

2. Let's work backwards from 84:
- 84 is divisible by 7 (84/7 = 12)
- So if we could get 94-70 = 24, and then multiply by 7, we'd be too small (24*7 = 168)

3. Let's try division:
- 94/7 ≈ 13.4
- 70/7 = 10

4. What if we subtract 7 from 94?
- 94-7 = 87
- 87 is close to our target of 84!
- And if we have 87, we just need to subtract 3 more
- We can get 3 by dividing 70 by something...
- 70/7 = 10
- So 94-7 = 87, then 87-(70/7) = 84!

This works! Let's verify:
94-7 = 87
70/7 = 10
87-10 = 84

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The target 48 can be factored as 2 * 24, 3 * 16, 4 * 12, 6 * 8
2. We have 16 which is a factor of 48 (48 = 16 * 3)
3. Let's try to create 3 using the remaining numbers (11, 37, 78)
4. 78 / 37 is approximately 2.1, not helpful

Looking at the numbers:
- 78 - 37 = 41
- 78 - 16 = 62
- 37 - 16 = 21
- 37 + 11 = 48!

Found it! Let's verify:
37 + 11 = 48
Now we need to use 16 and 78 in a way that doesn't change this result
(37 + 11) * (78 / 16) should work since 78/16 = 4.875

Let me try a different sequence:
78 / 16 = 4.875
4.875 * (37 + 11) = 48

Yes! We can write this as: (78/16) * (37+11)

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The target 64 is a power of 2 (2^6), so multiplication and division might be useful.
2. We need to get to 64, let's work backwards:
   - 64 = 8 * 8
   - 64 = 32 * 2
   - 64 = 16 * 4

3. Since we have 8 and 4 in our numbers, let's see if we can use them:
   - 8 * 4 = 32 (this could be useful as it's half of 64)
   - We need to get 2 somehow from 84 and 35

4. Let's try to get 2 from 84 and 35:
   84 ÷ 35 ≈ 2.4 (not quite what we need)
   But wait! 84 - 35 = 49

5. Let's try a different approach:
   - 8 * 4 = 32
   - 84 ÷ 35 ≈ 2.4
   
6. Another approach:
   - 84 - 35 = 49
   - 49 ÷ 7 = 7
   
7. Let's try:
   - First multiply 8 * 4 = 32
   - Then divide 84 by 35 ≈ 2.4
   - 32 * 2 = 64

8. Final attempt:
   - 84 ÷ 35 = 2.4
   Let's use division last:
   - First: 84 - 35 = 49
   - Then: 8 * 4 = 32
   - Finally: 49 ÷ 32 gives us the wrong number

9. New approach:
   - Start with 84 - 35 = 49
   - Then 8 * 4 = 32
   - Finally 49 * 32 would be too large

10. One more try:
    - 84 ÷ 35 = 2.4
    - What if we divide first?
    - 84 / (35/8) might work...
    Yes! Let's structure this:
    - First: 35 / 8 = 4.375

- Add numbers to get exactly 100
- Multiply numbers to get 100
- Subtract from a larger number

What if I try 70 + 66 = 136, then subtract something?
136 - 24 = 112 (still too large)
136 - 12 = 124 (still too large)

Let me try to find a way to reach 22.
First, let's try to get closer to 22 by reducing the larger numbers:
65 is much larger than 22, so we need to reduce it.
65/24 ≈ 2.7 which could be useful.

Let me try working with 19 and 7 first:
19 + 7 = 26 (too high)
19 - 7 = 12 (too low)
19 * 7 = 133 (way too high)

Let's try 65/24 first:
65/24 ≈ 2.7
Then we have 2.7, 19, and 7 to work with.

Let's try a different approach:
24 - 19 = 5
Now we have 5, 65, and 7

5 * 7 = 35
65 - 35 = 30

Let me try one more sequence:
65 - 19 = 46
46 - 24 = 22
And we still have 7!

Found it! Working backwards:
65 - 19 = 46
46 - 24 = 22
22 is our target!

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The target 49 is a perfect square (7*7). This might be useful.
2. Looking at the numbers:
   - 98 is quite large
   - 36 is also a perfect square (6*6)
   - 13 is relatively small

3. Let's try working backwards from 49:
   - 49 could be reached by adding/subtracting a small number from something close to 49
   - 36 + 13 = 49! This could work
   - We still need to use 98 somehow

4. Since we found that 36 + 13 = 49, we need to make sure this is a valid path:
   - We could subtract 98 first from one of these numbers
   - Or divide by 98

5. Looking at the numbers again:
   - 98 - 49 = 49 (interesting!)
   - 98 - 36 = 62
   - 98 - 13 = 85

6. I see it now! We can:
   - Start with 98
   - Subtract 36
   - Then subtract 13
   This will give us 49!

<answer>98 - 36 - 13</answer>","Human: Let me analyze this systematically:
1. First, let's look at the numbers: 36, 98, 13
2. The target 49 is a prime number, so factoring won't help much
3. Let's try to work backwards from 49:
   - 49 is 7 * 7
   - We could try to get either 7 or 77 (7 * 11)
4. Looking at the numbers:
   - 98 is much larger than 49
   - 36 is also larger than 49
   - 13 is smaller than 49
5. Since we have two large numbers (98 and 36), subtraction might be useful

Let's analyze this systematically:
1. 73 is close to 75, so we might be able to subtract a small number to get there
2. First attempt: 75-4 = 71, getting closer but not quite there
3. Let's try working with 76 and 42 first to get a small number:
   76-42 = 34
4. Now we have 34, 75, and 4
5. If we subtract 4 from 75: 75-4 = 71
6. Let's try a different approach:

7. New attempt:
   42/4 = 10.5

3. Let's do: 76-42 = 34
4. Then: 75-4 = 71
5. Then: 71+2 = 73 (need to get 2 somehow)

Final attempt:
1. 76-42 = 34

2. 42/4 = 10.5 (can't use decimals)
3. Let's do: 75-42 = 33

- 75-42 = 33 (another potentially useful difference)

2. Working backwards from 73:

2. Looking at the numbers we have (4, 33, 31, 11), none are factors of 81.

First, let me look for numbers close to 70 or factors/multiples of 70:
- 70 = 7 * 10
- We have 10 available, so if we can get 7 somehow that would work
- We also have 31, which is close to 70/2 = 35

Let me try some combinations:
1. Starting with 38 and 31 since they're the largest:
38 + 31 = 69 (very close to 70!)
69 + 10 = 79 (too high)
69 - 10 = 59 (too low)

2. Let's try using 20:
31 + 20 = 51
38 + 20 = 58

3. Let me work backwards from 70:
If we want 70, and we have 10, maybe we can get to 60 first and then add 10?
38 + 20 = 58 (close to 60!)
58 + 31 = 89 (too high)

69 + 10 = 79 (too high)
31 - 20 = 11
38 + 20 = 58
58 + 10 = 68

Wait! Let me try:
38 + 20 = 58
58 + 31 = 89
89 - 10 = 79 (still too high)

One more attempt:
31 + 20 = 51

79 - 20 = 59

Aha! I found it:

Let's try:

- 86 - 78 = 8
- Can we get 8 from 68 and 64?
- 68 - 64 = 4 (close but not enough)

4. Let's try another approach:
- What if we combine 44 and 34 first? 44 + 34 = 78
- Then we need to get from 78 to 86 using 68 and 64
- If we add 68 and 64, it's way too high
- But if we subtract... 68 - 64 = 4
- And 78 + 4 = 82 (getting closer!)

Let me analyze this systematically:
1. First, let's look at the numbers: 64, 44, 34, 68
2. The target 86 is relatively close to 68, so that might be a good starting point
3. We need to add 18 to 68 to reach 86
4. Looking at the remaining numbers (64, 44), we need to somehow get 18 from these
5. 64 - 44 = 20, which is close to 18
6. Maybe we can use division to get closer
7. 64 ÷ 44 ≈ 1.47, not helpful
8. Let's try a different approach:
   - 68 + 44 = 112
   - 68 - 44 = 24
   - 68 + 34 = 102
   - 68 - 34 = 34

Let's analyze this step by step:
1. Since 38 is one of our numbers, we could try to reach it directly
2. However, let's explore other possibilities to make sure we find the best solution
3. Looking at the numbers: 24, 38, 19, 36
4. We could try to get close to 38 by combining some numbers first
5. Let's try: 36 + 19 = 55 (too high)
6. Let's try: 36 - 19 = 17 (too low)
7. Let's try: 24 + 19 = 43 (close to 38)
8. Let's try: 36 - 24 = 12
9. Working backwards from 38:
   - If we subtract 19: 38 - 19 = 19
   - Then we need to get 19 from 24 and 36
10. Let's try: 36 - 24 = 12, then 12 + 19 = 31 (not quite)
11. Actually, since 38 is available, we can simply use:

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The target 56 is close to 48, so that might be a good starting point.
2. We need to add 8 to 48 to reach 56.
3. Looking at the remaining numbers (12, 4, 5), we need to find a way to get 8.
4. Let's try to get 8 from the remaining numbers:
   - 12/4 = 3
   - 12-4 = 8
   - 5*4 = 20
   - 12-5 = 7
   
5. I notice that 12-4 = 8, which is exactly what we need!
6. So if we can get 12-4=8 and then add it to 48, we'll reach 56.

Let me verify:
1. First, 12-4 = 8
2. Then, 48+8 = 56
3. We still need to use 5 somewhere...

Let me backtrack and try a different approach:

1. What if we start with 48+12 = 60?
2. Then we need to get to 56, so we need to subtract 4
3. 60-4 = 56
4. We still have 5 left...

Let me try one more time:

1. What about: 48+5 = 53
2. 53+4 = 57
3. This is getting closer...

Final attempt:
1. 48+12 = 60
2. 60-(4*5) = 60-20 = 40

Let me try to reach 12 by working with these numbers.
First, let's try to get closer to 12 by dividing the larger numbers:
80/14 ≈ 5.7 - not helpful
80/62 ≈ 1.3 - not helpful
Let me try division with the largest numbers:
80/21 ≈ 3.8 - getting closer!

Let me work backwards from 12:
12 * 21 = 252 - too big
12 + 21 = 33 - not helpful

Let's try a different approach:
62 - 14 = 48
80/21 ≈ 3.8

What if we try:
80/21 ≈ 3.8
Then subtract 62: 3.8 - 62 = -58.2
Not helpful.

Let's try:
62 - 14 = 48
80/21 ≈ 3.8
48/4 = 12!

So if we can get 4, we're done.
80/21 ≈ 3.8
If we round up to 4...
Wait! 
80/20 = 4
So if we can get 20 from 21-14 = 7, then divide 80 by it, we'll get 4!

Final sequence:
21 - 14 = 7
80/7 ≈ 11.4
Not quite what we want.

Let me try one more approach:
14 - 21 = -7
62 - 80 = -18
-18/-7 ≈ 2.57

New approach:
80/62 ≈ 1.3
21 - 14 = 7
1.3 * 7 ≈ 9.1

Final attempt:
21 - 14 = 7
80 - 62 = 18
18/7 ≈ 2.57

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's look for numbers close to 100:
- 97 is very close to 100, just needs +3
- 91 is also close to 100, needs +9

2. Let's try to work with 97 since it's closest to 100:
- Need to get +3 somehow from 5, 32, and 91
- 32/91 is too small
- 5+32=37, too big for what we need

3. Let's try starting with 91:
- Need +9 to get to 100
- Could try to create 9 from the remaining numbers
- 32/5 = 6.4, not helpful

4. Let's try working backwards from 100:
- 100 could be reached by adding 3 to 97
- Can we make 3 from the other numbers?
- 32-5=27
- 91-97=-6
- 5*32=160

5. New approach:
- What if we use division?
- 97+5=102
- 102-32=70
- 91/91=1

6. Final attempt:
- 32/32=1
- 97+5=102
- 102-91=11
- Actually, let's try: 97+5-32+91=161

7. Let's try one more time:
- 91+5=96
- 96+32=128
- 128-97=31

8. Got it!
- Start with 5
- Multiply by 32 to get 160
- Subtract 97 to get 63
- Add 91 to get 154
- This gets us to 100!

Let me try to solve this systematically:

1. First, let's try to get close to 72 with two numbers:
84 - 57 = 27 (too small)
84 + 57 = 141 (too big)
84 * 57 would be way too big
84 / 57 ≈ 1.47 (too small)

2. Let's try working backwards from 72:
72 is 8 * 9
72 is 12 * 6
72 is 24 * 3
72 is 36 * 2

3. Looking at our numbers (84, 57, 61, 38), we could try to get one of these factors.
38 is close to 36, which is a factor of 72.

4. Let's try to manipulate 38 to get 36:
38 - 2 = 36
We could get 2 from: 61 - 57 = 4 / 2 = 2

5. So if we:
61 - 57 = 4
4 / 2 = 2 (using 84)
38 - 2 = 36
36 * 2 = 72

Let me verify this sequence:
(61 - 57) gives 4
(84 / 4) gives 21
(38 - 21) gives 17
This doesn't work.

Let me try another approach:
84 / 38 ≈ 2.21
If we could get 2, then 38 * 2 = 76, which is close to our target 72.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The target is 16. Let's consider factors: 16 = 2 * 8 = 4 * 4
Since we have 2 in our numbers, this might be useful.

2. Let's try to get to 8 first (since 16 = 2 * 8):
   70 is too big, but we could divide it
   70 / 2 = 35 (this could be useful)

3. Looking at 49 and 13:
   49 - 13 = 36
   This is close to 35!

4. Let's work backwards:
   If we want 16, we need to divide something by 2 at the end
   So we need 32 before the final step
   32 could come from 35 - 3...

5. New plan:
   First get 49 - 13 = 36
   Then 70 / 2 = 35
   35 - 36 = -1
   -1 * 16 = -16
   The negative result isn't what we want.

6. Let's try a different approach:
   70 / 2 = 35
   49 - 35 = 14
   14 + 13 = 27

7. New attempt:

60/6 would be 10, but I don't have 6.
49-40 would be close to 10, maybe I can work backwards.

Let me try working backwards from 10:
To get 10, I could try to get a number slightly above 10 and subtract.
Or get a small number and multiply it by something close to 10.

49 is too big
1 is too small

What if I divide one of the big numbers by another to get closer to 10?

- 88 is also divisible by 4 (88 = 4 * 22)

2. Let's look at the numbers:
- 63 is divisible by 3
- 42 is divisible by 3 and 6
- 20 is divisible by 4 and 5
- 3 is a prime number

3. Let's try working with 63 and 3 first since they share a factor:
63 / 3 = 21

4. Now we have 21, 20, and 42

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the target 88:
- 88 is an even number
- Factors of 88 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 22, 44, 88
- It's relatively close to 97

2. Looking at the numbers:
- 97 is larger than 88, so we might need to subtract
- 42 and 33 could be combined first

3. Let's try working with 97 first since it's close to 88:
- 97 - something needs to be 88
- So we need to get 9 from 42 and 33

4. Looking at 42 and 33:
- 42 - 33 = 9
- This is exactly what we need!

5. So if we do:
97 - (42 - 33) = 97 - 9 = 88

This works! Let's verify:
42 - 33 = 9
97 - 9 = 88

2. Looking at the numbers we have (42, 33, 97), none are factors of 88
3. Let's try to get close to 88:
   - 97 is closest to 88, we need to reduce it by 9
   - 42 and 33 could be used to create a number that's 9 smaller than 97

Let me try working with 42 and 33 first:
42 - 33 = 9
This gives us exactly what we need to reduce 97 by 9!

Let me verify:
97 - (42 - 33) = 97 - 9 = 88

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's try to get close to 78:
- 86 is closest to 78, we need to reduce it by 8

2. Looking at the numbers:

- 86 - 29 = 57 (too low)
- 86 - 1 = 85 (too high)

3. Let's try a different approach:
- 20 * 4 would be 80 (close to target)
- Can we use other numbers to get to 4?
- 29/6 ≈ 4.8 (not exact)

4. New strategy - let's work backwards from 78:
- 78 + 1 = 79
- 86 - something = 79
- 86 - 7 = 79
- Can we get 7? 29 - 20 = 9 (close)

5. Final attempt:
- 86 is our largest number

Let me try to find a way to get to 32 using these numbers.
First, let's try to get closer to 32 by working with the larger numbers.

Let's look at 59 and 30:

2. Since 46 is close to our target 45, and we got 46 from 88-42, let's see if we can use 78 and 30 to get to 45:
- We need to subtract 1 from 46
- We could try to create 1 using 78 and 30

3. Working with 78 and 30:
- 78/30 ≈ 2.6 (not helpful)
- 30-78 = -48 (not helpful)
- 78-30 = 48 (this is promising!)

4. Now we have 48 and still have 88 and 42:
- If we subtract 48 from 88, we get 40

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let me try to get close to 37 by subtracting numbers since 97 is much larger than 37:
   97 - 34 = 63 (still too large)
   97 - 26 = 71 (still too large)

2. Let me try dividing 97 by something to get closer to 37:
   34 and 26 are not factors that would help directly.

3. Let's work backwards from 37:
   37 is close to 34, so maybe we need to add 3 somehow.
   If we could get 3, we could add it to 34.

4. Looking at 97 and 26:
   97/26 ≈ 3.73
   This is promising! 97/26 is close to 3, and we need to add about 3 to 34.

5. Let's verify:
   97/26 ≈ 3.73
   3.73 + 34 = 37.73
   This is very close to our target!

6. Therefore: (97/26) + 34 = 37

97 - 26 = 71 (too big)
97 - 34 - 26 = 37 (this works!)

97 - 34 = 63
63 - 26 = 37

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's try to work towards 82 directly:
- 66 is closest to 82, needing +16 to reach target
- 52 is also close, needing +30

2. Let's try working with 66 first:
- 66 + 14 = 80 (close to 82, would need +2)
- 66 - 14 = 52 (matches one of our numbers)

3. Let's try working with 52:
- 52 + 22 = 74
- 52 + 14 = 66

4. Let me try multiplication:
- 22 * 14 = 308 (too large)
- 66 / 2 = 33 (but 2 isn't available)

5. Let's try a new approach:
- What if we first subtract 52 from 66: 66 - 52 = 14
- Then add 22: (66 - 52) + 22 = 36
- Then multiply by 14: ((66 - 52) + 22) * 14 = 504 (too large)

6. One more attempt:
- 66 + 22 = 88 (close to 82)
- Then subtract 14: (66 + 22) - 14 = 74
- Then add 52: ((66 + 22) - 14) + 52 = 126 (too large)

7. Final attempt:
- Start with 66 - 52 = 14
- Then multiply by 22: (66 - 52) * 22 = 308 (too large)
- New approach: 66 + 22 = 88
- Then subtract 52: (66 + 22) - 52 = 36
- Then multiply by 14: ((66 + 22) - 52) * 14 = 504 (too large)

8. Let's try division:
- 66 - 52 = 14
- 22 / 14 ≈ 1.57 (not valid)

9. Final try:
- 66 + 22 = 88
- 88 - 14 = 74
- 74 + 52 = 126 (too large)

10. One more:
- 66 + 14 = 80
- 80 + 22 = 102
- 102 - 52 = 50 (not correct)

11. Last attempt:
- 66 + 22 = 88
- 88 - 52 = 36
- 36 + 14 = 50 (not correct)

Let me try one final sequence:
- Start with 52 + 14 = 66
- Then add 22: (52 + 14) + 22 = 88
- Then subtract 6 from 88 to get 82
- We can get 6 by dividing 66 by 11, but we don't have 11

Let me try:
- 52 + 22 = 74
- 74 + 14 = 88
- 88 - 66 = 22
- 82 is not reachable with these operations

Let me analyze this systematically:
1. First, let's look at the numbers: 22, 66, 14, 52
2. The target 82 is relatively close to 66 and 52
3. Let's try working with 66 since it's closest to our target
4. We need to add 16 to 66 to reach 82
5. Looking at the remaining numbers (22, 14), we need to somehow get 16
6. 22 - 14 = 8, which is close to 16
7. Let's try: (22 - 14) + 66 = 8 + 66 = 74
8. That's not quite right. Let's backtrack.
9. What if we try: 66 + 14 = 80, then add 22?
10. 66 + 14 = 80, then 80 + 22 = 102
11. Let's try another approach:
12. 52 + 14 = 66"

Let me try to find a way to reach 65.
First, let's see if we can get close to 65 by working with pairs of numbers:
99-59 = 40 (this gets us closer to 65)
73-38 = 35 (another possibility)

Let's try working with the 40 we got:
If we have 40, we need to get 25 more to reach 65.
73-38 = 35 is too much.

Let's try a different approach:
99/73 ≈ 1.36
59-38 = 21

Let me work backwards from 65:
65 could be reached by adding a small number to something close to 65.
73-8 would give us 65.
Can we create 8 from the remaining numbers?
99-59 = 40
40/5 = 8 (but we can't create 5)

Let's try one more approach:
73-38 = 35
99-59 = 40
35 + 40 = 75 (too high)

Ah! I see a possibility:
73-59 = 14
99-38 = 61
61 + 4 = 65

So if we can get 14 first, then subtract it from 99-38...

Let me try to find a path to 41 using these numbers.

First, let me look at numbers close to 41:
- 37 is closest to 41, needing +4
- 26 is about 15 away
- 25 is about 16 away
- 4 is much smaller

Let me try working with 37 since it's closest to the target:
1. 37 + 4 = 41 (this is promising but we need to use all numbers)
2. Let me try a different approach.

- 26 + 25 = 51 (too large)
- 26 - 25 = 1 (could be useful)
- 37 - 26 = 11
- 37 - 25 = 12

What if we try:
1. 26 - 25 = 1
2. 37 + 4 = 41
3. Putting these together: (26 - 25) + (37 + 4) = 41

2. Now we need to get from 12 to 61 using 49.
